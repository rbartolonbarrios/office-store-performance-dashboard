# Office Store Performance Dashboard

This project explores the sales trends and profitability of office products over the past four years using Tableau. Through visualizations, we analyze product categories, subcategories, and customer purchase trends to uncover valuable insights.

## Overview
In this Tableau story, multiple visualizations are used to examine:
- The top-selling office product categories
- The profitability of each product category
- Detailed analysis of the printing and technology categories
- The highest-selling products in those categories (graphing calculators)
- Geographic segmentation of graphing calculator buyers across the US
